## Orbital OpenApi Specification

### Introduction
The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both developers and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

The output of an OpenAPI Specification is a document or documents that define the API. The format is usually `YAML` or `JSON`, however YAML is the preferred standard due to its human-readable syntax. 



### Creating an OpenAPI document 
Recommended Text Editors:
- VSCode IDE with 'YAML' (Red Hat) extension 
- Swagger Editor: https://editor.swagger.io/
- Sublime with 'Pretty YAML' plugin


For Orbital, a sample OpenAPI document in YAML can be located within the `Orbital-Demo` repository accessible via: https://github.com/FociSolutions/Orbital-Demo/blob/develop/Samples/pet-store-example.yml.

The `pet-store-example.yml` sample document serves to assist developers with syntax, indentation formatting and pathing specifications. For further information on creating OpenAPI documents, please refer to the Swagger OpenAPI documentation here: https://swagger.io/specification/
